This implementation represents a comprehensive Activity Driven Model for Opinion Dynamics, designed to simulate the complex process of opinion formation and dissemination within networks of interacting agents. The model considers a wide range of factors that significantly enhance the study of how opinions evolve, spread, and consolidate in social networks.

Key Features and Enhancements:
Dynamic Opinion Evolution:

The model captures the nuanced interactions that drive consensus formation, polarization, and the impact of external influencers like bots. It provides a versatile framework to explore various scenarios by allowing users to adjust parameters related to agent activity, social influence, homophily, and other social dynamics.
Bot Influence Simulation:

Reflecting the growing significance of bots in social media environments, this model incorporates agents with fixed opinions (bots). These bots interact with human agents, influencing opinion dynamics without being influenced themselves, thereby simulating real-world conditions where bots play a role in shaping public discourse.
Activity-Driven Interactions:

As the name suggests, the model is driven by the activities of agents, representing their interactions within a social network. It includes the concept of eps (epsilon), which is the minimum activity level of agents. This feature introduces flexibility, allowing the model to accommodate agents with low but non-zero activity levels, mirroring real-world social media behavior where some users are highly active while others participate sporadically.
Controversialness of Topics:

The model acknowledges the role of controversialness in driving social interactions. Controversial topics tend to attract more attention and provoke more interactions, leading to more intense opinion dynamics. By incorporating this factor, the model can simulate how different levels of controversy affect the spread and polarization of opinions.
Highly Configurable Framework:

The model's configurability allows researchers to tailor simulations to specific research questions. Parameters such as social influence strength, homophily, reciprocity, and activity levels can be finely tuned, enabling the exploration of diverse social phenomena from the emergence of echo chambers to the impact of social interventions.
Reluctance to Change:

The model introduces the concept of reluctance, reflecting an agent's resistance to changing their opinion. This feature is crucial for simulating realistic scenarios where certain agents or groups are more steadfast in their beliefs, affecting the overall dynamics of opinion evolution.
Covariance of Activity and Reluctance:

An additional layer of realism is introduced by considering the covariance between an agentâ€™s activity level and their reluctance to change opinions. This correlation can simulate scenarios where more active agents are either more resistant or more open to influence, depending on the direction of the covariance.
Social Network Structure:

The model can account for the underlying social network structure, where the strength of ties and the frequency of interactions influence the overall opinion dynamics. This aspect is vital for studying how network topology affects the spread of opinions and the formation of clusters or communities within the network.
